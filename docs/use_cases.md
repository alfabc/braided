# Network health
As a professional working in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, I am interested in seeing the state of various blockchains and forks, the clients that run them, and the services built on top of the clients.  I want to see a row or column of blocks for each known chain, the connections between those chains, and the health of the overall system. When a particular chain goes down, I want to see its effect on other chains, how it may have forked, and how that has affected the rest of the blockchain internetwork.

# Chain integrity verification
As a user of a specific blockchain application (especially those running on privately managed chains) I want to see proof that the chain on which I am depending has not been modified retroactively.

# Transaction integrity verification
As a user of any blockchain, I want to know how certain I can be that a specific transaction has not been forged.

For example, when I am shown a transaction ID on a site (e.g. Etherscan) I would like to see just how sure I am that the transaction has not been forged.  This is extremely difficult with very small chains which do not have tools such as Etherscan â€” small PoA networks for specific applications, sidechains, etc.  In this case I would like to be able to click on the TXID and see the position of that transaction in a block on that chain, and how that block (or subsequent blocks) are recorded in other chains, and thus how much confidence I can have that the transaction has not been (and will not be) forged, disappeared, or otherwise interefered with.
